## Code Updates

## Bugs:
- [ ] Name/Last is in profile settings, and name you want to be called is in sign up - This is totally backwards and needs to be updated.
    - [ ] Some of the items in the sign up that are together should not be together
    - [ ] We want to make sure that when there is an input and you hit enter, if there is another field, it goes to that and if there is not, it does continue automatically
    - [ ] We need to have a consistent style and position to the label for each step and the description. They all need to be at the top so they don't jump around. (In fixing this, we cannot mess up the fact that we've worked hard to make sure these steps never scroll on mobile, even if the keyboard comes up for the ones that are text.)
    - [ ] The Birthday step shows age and sign at the bottom but the text wraps and looks horrible! This is a cool feature. Let's show it off by making them look nice and put the two facts on separate lines
    - [ ] Let's make 'who are you interested in' have the same compoonent as the one before it for gender for more consistentcy
    - [ ] "What are you looking for?" and "Marital Status" Should be two separate steps and marital status should come before dating intentions.
    - [ ] Avoid dropdowns when we can easily fit the options in a list instead that just shows the options. Only use a drodown if a list would not fit and would cause a scroll. There are manuy examples, but some of them are: Body type, Dating Intentions, Marital status,
