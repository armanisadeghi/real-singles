# ship.sh — sync this checkout with GitHub, then release. (Arman, 2026-09-24)
#
#   1. scripts/sync-main.py   commits everything uncommitted ("local work not committed by agents
#                             who made them"), merges origin/main, sorts every conflict into
#                             _conflicts/ (auto-fixed / both-versions-kept / held), pushes.
#   2. the release script     scripts/release.sh (or ./release.sh): bumps the version and ships.
#                             Runs whatever happened in step 1. If this repo has no release
#                             script, ship.sh says so and stops after the sync.
#   3. the open items         prints what is open in _conflicts/README.md, if anything, for the
#                             agent that resolves conflicts.
#
# Usage:
#   ./ship.sh                                   # sync + release with the default note
#   ./ship.sh "Added new chat surface"          # sync + release with a note
#   ./ship.sh "note" --minor                    # release flags pass through
#   ./ship.sh "note" --dry-run                  # NO sync; release --dry-run only
