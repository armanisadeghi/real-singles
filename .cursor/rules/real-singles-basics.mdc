# RealSingles

A modern, elegant dating app targeting discerning users who value authenticity.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Web | Next.js 16 (App Router) on Vercel |
| Mobile | Expo (React Native) — iOS + Android |
| Backend | Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS (web), platform-native (mobile) |

## Core Philosophy

1. **Identical functionality, native feel.** Every feature works on all platforms, but each platform uses its native UI patterns.
2. **Single source of truth.** All business logic lives in API endpoints—clients never implement logic locally.
3. **High-quality, native-first code.** Clean, efficient implementations that respect platform conventions.

## Exception

Admin portal is web-only. All user-facing features must exist on all platforms.
