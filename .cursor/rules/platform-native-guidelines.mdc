# Platform-Native Guidelines

All platforms must feel authentically native—iOS apps should feel like iOS, Android like Android, web like modern web.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Native components, not JS approximations.** Use actual platform components, not JS that mimics their appearance.

2. **Don't override platform defaults.** If the platform handles something automatically (colors, spacing, animations, safe areas), don't fight it.

3. **Less code = more native.** Extensive styling usually means you're overriding native behavior.

## Platform Icons

| Platform | Library | Never Use |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| iOS | SF Symbols (`expo-symbols`) | Icon fonts, PNGs, emoji |
| Android | Material Icons (`@expo/vector-icons/MaterialIcons`) | Icon fonts, emoji |
| Web | `lucide-react` | Emoji |

---

## Native-Backed Libraries (Mobile)

| ✅ Use | ❌ Not |
|--------|--------|
| `expo-router/unstable-native-tabs` | `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` (JS-drawn) |
| `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` with native driver | Custom `Animated.View` sheets |
| `react-native-gesture-handler` + `react-native-reanimated` | JS touch handlers, Animated API |
| Native pickers (`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`) | Custom picker implementations |

---

## Design Languages (2026)

| Platform | Pattern | Key Characteristics |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| iOS 26 | Liquid Glass | Translucent nav/tab bars, `PlatformColor` for system colors |
| Android 16 | Material 3 Expressive | Edge-to-edge mandatory, dynamic Material You colors |
| Web | Modern CSS | Container queries, `@starting-style`, native `<dialog>`/`popover` |

---

## Animations: Spring Physics

All platforms use spring-based motion. Never use linear or basic ease curves for interactive elements.

| Use Case | Spring Config (damping/stiffness) |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Button feedback | 20 / 300 |
| Card expand | 12 / 180 |
| Sheet/page transition | 18 / 120–200 |
| Default | 15 / 150 |

**Mobile:** `react-native-reanimated` with `withSpring()`
**Web:** `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` or similar spring curves

---

## Accessibility

All platforms must respect user preferences:

- **Reduced motion:** Disable/minimize animations when `prefers-reduced-motion` (web) or `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled` (mobile)
- **Reduced transparency:** Fall back from glass effects when enabled
- **High contrast:** Increase border weights, avoid low-contrast colors
- **Touch targets:** Minimum 44×44px on all platforms

---

## Safe Areas

| Platform | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| iOS | Native components handle it; don't add manual padding |
| Android | `useSafeAreaInsets()` from `react-native-safe-area-context` |
| Web | `env(safe-area-inset-*)` CSS, `pb-safe` Tailwind class |

---

## Quick Tests

- **Mobile:** "Would this look identical if built in Swift/Kotlin?" If no, you're overriding native behavior.
- **Web:** "Am I using modern CSS features instead of JS workarounds?" If no, check for native browser APIs.

## Detailed Platform Skills

For implementation details, use the specialized skills:
- `.cursor/skills/ios-native-expert/` — SF Symbols 7, Liquid Glass, haptics
- `.cursor/skills/android-native-expert/` — M3 Expressive, edge-to-edge, Material You
- `.cursor/skills/modern-web-design-expert/` — 2026 CSS, responsive patterns, performance
- `.cursor/skills/feature-parity-check/` — Cross-platform verification workflow

---

## Reference Implementation

`mobile/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` — Minimal code, fully native tabs, platform icons
