# Native Feel Guidelines

**Target audience:** Senior developers who know React Native and platform conventions.

---

## Core Principle

Use actual native components. Not JS approximations that mimic native appearance.

---

## Rules

1. **Don't override platform defaults.** If iOS or Android handles something automatically, don't customize it. This includes colors, spacing, animations, and haptics.

2. **Use platform-native icons.**
   - iOS: SF Symbols (`expo-symbols`)
   - Android: Material Icons or properly-sized PNGs (24dp)

3. **Prefer native-backed libraries.**
   - ✅ `expo-router/unstable-native-tabs` (actual `UITabBarController`/`BottomNavigationView`)
   - ❌ `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` (JS-drawn views)
   - ✅ `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` with native driver
   - ❌ Custom `Animated.View` bottom sheets
   - ✅ `react-native-gesture-handler` + `react-native-reanimated` (native thread)
   - ❌ JS-based touch handlers and animations

4. **Trust safe area handling.** Native components handle safe areas. Don't add manual padding that fights the system.

5. **Less code = more native.** If you're writing extensive styling to "fix" how something looks, you're probably overriding native behavior.

## Reference Implementations

| Component | File | Notes |
|-----|---|----|
| Bottom Navigation | `mobile/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` | Best example—minimal code, fully native |

---

## Quick Test

Ask yourself: "Would this component look identical if I built it in Swift/Kotlin?"

If no, you're probably overriding platform behavior.
